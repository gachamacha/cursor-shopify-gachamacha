# Brand Colours

Below are the core brand colours used in the Shopify theme, based on the unified header design (Monochrome Luxe) and the website background:

- **Gold Accent:** #f0d080 (header, highlights)
- **Dark Background:** #181820 (header, footer)
- **White:** #fff (text, backgrounds)

## Website Background Gradient
- **Gradient:** `radial-gradient(ellipse at top left, #8B7355, #4A2E4A, #1a1a1a)`
  - **Champagne Gold:** #8B7355
  - **Deep Plum:** #4A2E4A
  - **Near-black:** #1a1a1a

**Usage Guidance:**
- Use **Dark Background** (#181820) for main backgrounds, header, and footer.
- Use **Gold Accent** (#f0d080) for key highlights, text, icons, and borders in the header and for branding emphasis.
- Use **White** (#fff) for text, backgrounds, and to provide contrast and clarity.
- The **website background** uses a soft, luxe radial gradient from champagne gold to deep plum to near-black. Use these tones for overlays, cards, or to complement the main background.

> These colors form the foundation of the brand's visual identity: a luxe, modern look with gold highlights and a rich, dark gradient background.
